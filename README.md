CK extensions - predictive analytics
====================================

This is a heavily evolving repository 
(stable release is expected in Spring 2015) - 
please, do not use it until official announcement.

We gradually simplify and convert old Collective Mind 
functionality to the new CK format!

This repository will expose user data and
experiments to predictive analytics
(statistical analysis, feature selection,
machine learning).

Dependencies
============

* Python:
** matplotlib
** Scipy
** Numpy

On Ubuntu, you can install packages using:
> sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib python-pandas

Useful:

* Graphviz
* R (for statistical analysis and machine learning, though Python may be enough)
