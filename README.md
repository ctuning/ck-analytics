CK extensions - predictive analytics
====================================

This is a heavily evolving repository 
(stable release is expected in Spring 2015) - 
please, do not use it until official announcement.

We gradually simplify and convert old Collective Mind 
functionality to the new CK format!

This repository will expose user data and
experiments to predictive analytics
(statistical analysis, feature selection,
machine learning).

Dependencies
============

* R
* Python matplotlib
