* 2015.12.15 * adding support to prune experimental vectors by threshold (when retrieving results):
                 "vector_thresholds" and "vector_thresholds_conditions" - useful to keep or skip
                 points with high variation, for example.

* 2015.12.14 * fixing bug in replay (by accident removed update of choices in pipeline)

* 2015.12.13 * improving reproducibility (experiment replay): 
               * adding '--deps' flag to reuse all SW deps when reproducing
                 experiment on the same machine; 
               * adding '--dims' to compare only one flat key (or use wildcards)
               * fixing bug with statistical repetitions 
                 (now taking the correct number from a given experiment)
 
* 2015.12.07 * taking statistical repetition number from the entry when replaying a given experiment
             * passing 'local_platform' and 'skip_clean_after' to program pipeline when
               replaying such experiments ...
             * fixing experiment dictionary output comparison during replay

* 2015.10.09 * added "zmin" and "zmax" params for 3D graphs
             * added "invert_x_axis", "invert_y_axis" and "invert_z_axis" to 3D graphs
             * added "x_ticks_scale", "y_ticks_scale", "z_ticks_scale" to 3D graphs
             * added "color_dict" to 3D graphs

* 2015.10.08 * added 'fmt' parameter to graphs
             * added 'font' parameters for graphs (size, weight, family)

* 2015.09.19 * added 'skip' flag to skip comparison of results during experiment 'replay'

* 2015.09.11 * added demo/ml-decision-tree - simple decision tree maker (suggested by Sergey Yakushkin)
             * added 'use' in 'model' to perform predictions
             * added model recording to CK entry and using model from CK entry 
               (to share and collaboratively improve predictive models)

* 2015.09.10 * added 'advice' module (about experiments, bugs, models, features, optimizations, adaptation, community remarks ...)

* 2015.09.09 * added 'skip_stat_analysis' to compact recorded data when stat analysis is not needed
               (useful for CLSmith)

* 2015.09.03 * fixed bug in showing +- % when 0 (noticed by Anton)

* 2015.09.02 * added extension to keys when retreiving experiments

* 2015.08.12 * added possibility to reverse key order in Pareto frontier filter during multi-objective autotuning 
               (useful for FPS in slambench, for example)
             * improving interactive graphs for interactive articles

* 2015.08.11 * added output of decision trees to png (for interactive reports and articles via CK)
             * added horizontal and vertical lines for graphs (used in graphs for adaptive scheduling (predictive modeling and active learning))

* 2015.08.09 * added extra dict when recording experiments (useful to record name and subview_uoa, for example)
             * fixing a few bugs in experiment viewing

* 2015.08.07 added reverse sorting in experiment tables
