* 2015.09.02 FGG: * adding extension to keys when retreiving experiments

* 2015.08.12 FGG: * adding possibility to reverse key order in Pareto frontier filter during multi-objective autotuning 
                    (useful for FPS in slambench, for example)
                  * improving interactive graphs for interactive articles

* 2015.08.11 FGG: * added output of decision trees to png (for interactive reports and articles via CK)
                  * added horizontal and vertical lines for graphs (used in graphs for adaptive scheduling (predictive modeling and active learning))

* 2015.08.09 FGG: * added extra dict when recording experiments (useful to record name and subview_uoa, for example)
                  * fixing a few bugs in experiment viewing

* 2015.08.07 added reverse sorting in experiment tables
