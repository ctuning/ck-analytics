* 2015.10.08 FGG: * adding 'fmt' parameter to graphs
                  * adding 'font' parameters for graphs (size, weight, family)

* 2015.09.19 FGG: * adding 'skip' flag to skip comparison of results during experiment 'replay'

* 2015.09.11 FGG: * adding demo/ml-decision-tree - simple decision tree maker (suggested by Sergey Yakushkin)
                  * adding 'use' in 'model' to perform predictions
                  * adding model recording to CK entry and using model from CK entry 
                    (to share and collaboratively improve predictive models)

* 2015.09.10 FGG: * adding 'advice' module (about experiments, bugs, models, features, optimizations, adaptation, community remarks ...)

* 2015.09.09 FGG: * adding 'skip_stat_analysis' to compact recorded data when stat analysis is not needed
                    (useful for CLSmith)

* 2015.09.03 FGG: * fixed bug in showing +- % when 0 (noticed by Anton)

* 2015.09.02 FGG: * adding extension to keys when retreiving experiments

* 2015.08.12 FGG: * adding possibility to reverse key order in Pareto frontier filter during multi-objective autotuning 
                    (useful for FPS in slambench, for example)
                  * improving interactive graphs for interactive articles

* 2015.08.11 FGG: * added output of decision trees to png (for interactive reports and articles via CK)
                  * added horizontal and vertical lines for graphs (used in graphs for adaptive scheduling (predictive modeling and active learning))

* 2015.08.09 FGG: * added extra dict when recording experiments (useful to record name and subview_uoa, for example)
                  * fixing a few bugs in experiment viewing

* 2015.08.07 added reverse sorting in experiment tables
