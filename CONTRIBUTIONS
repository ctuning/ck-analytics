CK uses standard 3-clause (new) BSD license. Contributions are welcome to
either improve existing functionality or add new functionality possibly using
new modules.

Contributors should clearly mark their contributions including date and remark.

This is still a relatively new project so we still discuss how to make
contributions easy and efficient.

For now, patches can be sent directly to the collective-mind@googlegroups.com

Bugs can be reported here:
